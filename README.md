Shopify Order Automation Workflow
Overview
This project automates key aspects of Shopify order management using Make.com. It automatically uploads customer information from new orders into a Google Sheet for easy tracking and updates the fulfillment status in Shopify once the store owner fulfills the order.

Features
Automated Customer Data Logging: Captures customer details from Shopify orders and appends them to a centralized Google Sheet, enabling streamlined order tracking and data analysis.

Fulfillment Status Update: Monitors order fulfillment status and automatically updates Shopify when the store owner marks an order as fulfilled, ensuring real-time inventory and order accuracy.

Technologies Used
Make.com (formerly Integromat) for automation scenarios

Shopify API for order data access and status updating

Google Sheets for data storage and management

How It Works
When a new order is placed in Shopify, the automation triggers and extracts customer information.

This data is uploaded to a predefined Google Sheet to maintain a live log of orders.

When the store owner fulfills an order, the automation detects this status change and updates Shopify accordingly.

Benefits
Reduces manual data entry and errors

Provides centralized order and customer tracking

Improves store operations efficiency through real-time updates
